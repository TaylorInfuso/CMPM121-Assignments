//Description:
//This program works with abstract data types to organize the contents 
//list objects. Integers are held within node objects. Multiple 
//functions exist to allow for alterations within the lists like 
//specific insertion and deletion. List.h and List.c maintain the lists
//and nodes in the project while ListClient.c can be used to run tests
//(all of which I was successful at implementing). I have not done much 
//with InsertSortLinked however.
